      <description>This post is to introduce a special proof of well known Von-Neumann’s minimax theorem. I mainly refer to the paper, Game Theory, On-line Prediction and Boosting and the course website, Game Theory. I think I will write at least two more posts about this paper. This first post is a summary of the description and proof of Von-Neumann’s minimax theorem.
First we define a two-player zero-sum game as the following.</description>

      <description>This post is to record my deployment of my notes in topics in mathematical statistics. This note is built on Rbookdown, I am really appreciated all of the contributors to this package. This package and Rblogdown are both amazing and truly friendly to anyone who does not familiar with designing website like html, css, javascript just like me. The most appealing part (at least for me) is they incorporate the R markdown which is awesome for showing some data analysis work.</description>
