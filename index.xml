      <description>This post is to record my deployment of my notes in topics in mathematical statistics. This note is built on Rbookdown, I am really appreciated all of the contributors to this package. This package and Rblogdown are both amazing and truly friendly to anyone who does not familiar with designing website like html, css, javascript just like me. The most appealing part (at least for me) is they incorporate the R markdown which is awesome for showing some data analysis work.</description>

      <description>Hello. I am Huei-Yuan Yao. You can find my CV here. This is my personal website. I am new to GitHub and also GitHub Pages so this site is still under construction. I am willing to apply for the Doctorate degree in U.S. (Fall 2023). I got my master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Statistics, National Cheng-Chi University. Before master degree, I had my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mathematics, National Taiwan University. My research interest includes (but not limited to) statistical inference of time series data, machine learning theory, sequential decision making under uncertainty and causal inference.</description>
